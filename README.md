# ProMathApplication
- Created Abstract class Shape with abstract readonly properties and static dictionary to keep count of objects initialized for it
- Square and Rectangle are derived from Quadrilateral
- Implemented ShapesManager to Sort
- Added PrintIntializedObjectList in Main to print list and count of objects initialized
- Implemented Factory pattern for Serialization
- Added PrintShapesToFile to save serialized data to file
- This is a simple app with no validations values of the shapes like side length cannot be negative
