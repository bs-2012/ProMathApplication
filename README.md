# ProMathApplication
Created Abstract class Shape with abstract readonly properties and static dictionary to keep count of objects initialized for it
Square and Rectangle are derived from Quadrilateral
Implemented ShapesManager to Sort and Serialize in Json
Added PrintIntializedObjectList in Main to print list and count of objects initialized
Added PrintShapesToFile to save serialized data to file
This is a simple app with no validations values of the shapes like side length cannot be negative
